# ANALYSING-CUSTOMER-CHURN-IN-BANKING-SECTOR

## About the project: 

### The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for analysing and addressing customer churn in the banking sector. In the banking sector, churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a bank by closing their accounts or ceasing to use the bank's products and services. It's the rate at which customers leave or "churn out" from a bank's customer base within a given period. The aim is to use customer details like credit score, location, age, balance, product usage, etc., to build a model that predicts if a customer is likely to leave the bank. Alongside the predictive model, I have designed an intuitive front-end interface that allows stakeholders to interact with the analysis effectively.
